# SourceCode folder

All *CLArgs.CommandRunner* projects reference the *CLArgs NuGet* package.

The `SourceCode` virtual folder is there for convenience, only. So that you as a developer can directly see the CLArgs source code.

The `SourceCode` folder is not required if you copy the *CLArgs.CommandRunner* skeleton ([see here](../README.md)).
